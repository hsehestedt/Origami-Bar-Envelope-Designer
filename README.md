In my digital world, I find that I often end up gathering a lot of items that I need to organize. For example, thumb drives, SD cards, laptop HDs, electronic parts such as resistors, LEDs, etc.

I came accross plans to make this very simple envelope and started to wonder if it would be possible to figure out a way to customize the envelope size to perfectly fit specific applications.

I like math. I like it a lot. It turns out that that with a small amount of simple math I was able to calculate how to make perfectly customized envelopes, tweak sizes, calculate page sizes, and more. With a minor modification, I realized that I could make sure that the front face of the envelope and the rear bar both lie on the same side of the page. That led to the calculation of the location of both the front face and the the bar on the envelope. Once we have those calculations it is easy to to print text or graphics to those areas on the page so that they end up in the right place when the envelope is folded.

The OBED (Origami Bar Envelope Designer) program will make all the calculation for you to help you do the following:

- Calculate the page size needed to  create an envelope of a specific size.
- Calculate the envelope size that would result from a specific page size.
- Calculate the exact position of the front face and bar on the page.
- Automatically "tweak" the page size so that it falls perfectly on a 1/16, 1/32, 1/64th etc. of an inch. This can be handy if you are manually laying out a page using a ruler (not needed if using metric units of measurement).

The documentation has probably way more information than you could ever want on this topic. Naturally, it covers the basics such as how to fold the envelope, but it also covers all the advanced topics such as all the math for the calculations. It will also show you how to layout the front face and bar on a page using Microsoft Publisher or another application of your choice. The documentation also includes 4" x 6" cards that summarize everything you might need and a seperate single page summary sheet is also included. For those that want to perform the calculations manually, there is also a set of worksheets to allow you to easily perform those calculations in a structured format.
